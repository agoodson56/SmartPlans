INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the uploaded construction documents (symbol legends, floor plans, specifications, addenda) for all low-voltage / ELV systems.
2. For each selected discipline, identify and count:
   - STRUCTURED CABLING: Data outlets, voice outlets, WAPs, fiber runs, MDF/IDF/TR rooms, cable tray, J-hooks, conduit, backbone cables
   - CCTV: Camera locations (fixed, PTZ, dome, bullet), NVR/VMS, monitors, exterior vs interior, pole mounts
   - ACCESS CONTROL: Controlled doors, reader locations, electrified hardware, REX devices, panels, credential type
   - AUDIO VISUAL: Displays, projectors, speakers, control panels, AV racks, video conferencing systems, digital signage
   - INTRUSION DETECTION: Motion detectors, door contacts, glass break sensors, keypads, panels, sirens
   - FIRE ALARM: Smoke detectors, heat detectors, pull stations, horn/strobes, duct detectors, FACP, NAC circuits
3. Cross-reference floor plan symbols against the symbol legend provided.
4. Check for discrepancies between plans, specifications, and any addenda.
5. Identify MDF/IDF/TR rooms and list infrastructure requirements (racks, power, cooling, grounding).
6. Provide a detailed analysis including:
   - Device counts by type, per sheet/floor
   - Cable/conduit pathway observations
   - Spec-to-plan conflicts
   - Missing information requiring RFIs
   - Scope gaps or ambiguities
   - Confidence level for each count
7. Reference industry standards where applicable: BICSI TDMM, TIA-568, TIA-569, TIA-606, TIA-607, NFPA 72, NEC Article 725/760/770, NFPA 101.
8. List specific, actionable RFI questions based on actual gaps found in these documents.
9. If known quantities were provided, compare your counts and flag deviations over 10%.

Format your response with clear sections using markdown headers. Organize by discipline. Be specific and reference sheet numbers where applicable.`;
