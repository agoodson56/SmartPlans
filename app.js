   LABOR ADJUSTMENT FACTORS (note these to the PM):
   - Working above 10 ft (ladder/lift required): multiply by 1.25
   - Existing/occupied building: multiply by 1.15
   - Concrete/masonry wall penetrations: add 0.5 hr per penetration
   - Union labor jurisdiction: check local rates and productivity factors

   **OFF-SHIFT / AFTER-HOURS WORK ADJUSTMENTS** — Apply these based on the work shift indicated above:

   SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL RATE MULTIPLIERS:
   | Shift | Typical Hours | Rate Premium | Productivity Factor | Effective Cost Multiplier |
   |-------|---------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
   | 1st Shift (Standard) | 7:00AM – 3:30PM | Base rate (1.0×) | 100% productivity | 1.0× |
   | 2nd Shift | 3:00PM – 11:30PM | Base + 10-15% differential | 90% productivity | ~1.20-1.28× |
   | 3rd Shift / Overnight | 11:00PM – 7:30AM | Base + 15-20% differential | 80-85% productivity | ~1.35-1.50× |
   | Saturday | 8 hrs | 1.5× base (OT) | 95% productivity | ~1.58× |
   | Sunday | 8 hrs | 2.0× base (DT) | 90% productivity | ~2.22× |
   | Holiday | 8 hrs | 2.0-2.5× base | 85% productivity | ~2.35-2.94× |
   | 4/10s (Mon-Thurs) | 10 hr/day | 1.0× for 8 hrs + 1.5× for 2 hrs OT/day | 95% avg | ~1.10× |
   | Split Shift | Varies | Base + coordination premium | 75-85% productivity | ~1.30-1.45× |

   OFF-SHIFT COST IMPACTS — Factor these into the estimate:
   - **Shift differential pay**: Additional hourly premium on top of base/prevailing wage rate
   - **Overtime (OT)**: 1.5× base rate after 8 hrs/day or 40 hrs/week (fringe stays at straight-time for prevailing wage)
   - **Double-time (DT)**: 2.0× base rate for Sundays, holidays, or 7th consecutive day worked
   - **Reduced productivity**: Night work is inherently less productive — apply efficiency loss factor
   - **Supervision premium**: Foreman/lead tech may require additional premium for off-shift

   OFF-SHIFT SITE CONDITIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR:
   - Security escort fees — some facilities require paid security to accompany after-hours crews ($50-$100/hr)
   - Building access coordination — key/badge management, alarm system deactivation
   - Temporary lighting — work lights for poorly lit areas at night (cost + setup time)
   - HVAC availability — building HVAC may be off during off-hours (extreme temps affect productivity)
   - Noise restrictions — no hammer drilling, sawing, or loud tools during certain hours (adjacent occupied spaces)
   - Elevator availability — may be locked out after hours, require operator or manual freight key
   - Loading dock hours — material deliveries may be restricted to daytime only
   - Parking — different rules/availability for off-shift crews
   - Emergency response time — reduced site staff means slower injury/incident response

   SHIFT WORK SCHEDULING NOTES FOR PM:
   - 2nd/3rd shift crews often need 1-2 days of overlap with 1st shift for coordination
   - Testing and commissioning typically MUST happen during normal business hours (stakeholder availability)
   - Fire alarm system testing must coordinate with building management and monitoring company
   - Weekend work in occupied buildings requires advance notice to tenants/management
   - Mixed-shift projects should identify which phases are off-shift vs standard

   LABOR SUMMARY — Produce the following:
   a) Calculate total labor hours per discipline using the units above × device counts
   b) Calculate total labor hours per MDF/IDF room
   c) Provide a grand total labor hours for the project
   d) Estimate crew size and duration (assume 8-hour days, 2-person crew minimum for safety)
   e) Break out labor into phases: Rough-In, Trim/Termination, Programming/Commissioning, Testing
   f) If off-shift: show base labor cost at standard rate vs adjusted off-shift cost side by side

10. **TRAVEL & PER DIEM EXPENSES** — If a project location was provided, evaluate whether travel expenses apply. For projects 100+ miles from the contractor's office, calculate out-of-town expenses using the following GSA (General Services Administration) federal per diem rate structure:

   TRAVEL EXPENSE CALCULATION:
   a) Determine if this is an out-of-town project (100+ miles from nearest office)
   b) Based on the total labor hours calculated above, determine:
      - Total on-site work days (labor hours ÷ 8 hours/day)
      - Number of overnight stays required
      - Number of mobilization/demobilization trips (typically one per phase: Rough-In, Trim, Programming, Testing/Commissioning)

   GSA PER DIEM RATES (use current standard rates, adjust for project city if known):
   | Expense Category | Standard Rate | High-Cost City Rate | Notes |
   |------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
   | Lodging (hotel) | $107/night | $150-$300/night | Use actual GSA rate for project city/county if known |
   | M&IE (Meals & Incidental Expenses) | $68/day | $74-$79/day | Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tips, misc |
   | First & Last Day M&IE | 75% of full rate | 75% of full rate | Travel days are reduced rate |
   | Rental car | $75/day | $75-$100/day | Mid-size SUV for tool/material transport |
   | Fuel / mileage | $0.70/mile | $0.70/mile | IRS standard mileage rate |

   | Phase | Crew Size | On-Site Days | Nights | Lodging | M&IE | Vehicle | Phase Total |
   |-------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|------|---------|-------------|
   | Rough-In | X | X | X | $X | $X | $X | $X |
   | Trim/Term | X | X | X | $X | $X | $X | $X |
   | Programming | X | X | X | $X | $X | $X | $X |
   | Testing/Commissioning | X | X | X | $X | $X | $X | $X |
   | Punch List | X | X | X | $X | $X | $X | $X |
   | **TOTAL** | | | | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** | **$X** |

   ADDITIONAL TRAVEL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Weekend return trips home (for jobs > 2 weeks, budget RT airfare/mileage every 2 weeks)
   - Tool shipping costs if flying (heavy test equipment: fusion splicer, OTDR, Fluke, fire alarm tools)

   - Multiple mobilization trips if phases are separated by weeks/months
   - Project manager site visits (separate from install crew, typically 1-2 day trips)

   If no project location is provided, include a note: "⚠️ Project location not specified — unable to calculate travel expenses. If this project is 100+ miles from your office, add travel costs."

11. **PREVAILING WAGE / DAVIS-BACON WAGE DETERMINATION** — If prevailing wage is indicated, this section is MANDATORY. Apply DOL (Department of Labor) wage classifications and rates to all labor calculations.

   WAGE CLASSIFICATION MAPPING FOR ELV TRADES:
   Identify the correct DOL wage classification for each type of work. Common classifications:

   | ELV Task | DOL Wage Classification | Typical WD Code |
   |----------|------------------------|------------------|
   | Structured Cabling (install, terminate, test) | Sound & Communication Installer / Telecom Technician | SCOM / TELE |
   | CCTV (camera install, NVR, programming) | Sound & Communication Installer | SCOM |
   | Access Control (readers, panels, hardware) | Sound & Communication Installer | SCOM |
   | Fire Alarm (devices, panels, wiring) | Electrician (Inside Wireman) — required in many jurisdictions | ELEC |
   | Intrusion Detection (sensors, panels) | Sound & Communication Installer | SCOM |
   | Audio Visual (speakers, displays, DSP) | Sound & Communication Installer | SCOM |
   | Conduit installation (EMT, rigid) | Electrician (Inside Wireman) | ELEC |
   | Cable tray installation | Electrician or Ironworker (varies by jurisdiction) | ELEC / IRON |
   | Trenching / Underground work | Laborer | LABR |
   | Equipment operation (lifts, boring) | Operating Engineer | OPER |
   | Firestopping | Laborer or Carpenter (varies) | LABR / CARP |
   | General material handling | Laborer | LABR |
   | Project Manager / Foreman (on-site) | Foreman rate (typically 10-15% above journeyman) | FORE |

   WAGE RATE STRUCTURE — For each classification, provide:
   | Classification | Base Rate/hr | Fringe Benefits/hr | Loaded Rate/hr |
   |----------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
   | Electrician (Inside Wireman) | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |
   | Sound & Communication Installer | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |
   | Telecom Technician | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |
   | Laborer | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |
   | Operating Engineer | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |
   | Foreman | $XX.XX | $XX.XX | $XX.XX |

   Use the project location to determine the correct county/locality wage rates. If the exact WD rates are not known, use representative national averages:
   - Electrician (Inside Wireman): Base $45-$55/hr + Fringe $25-$35/hr = Loaded $70-$90/hr
   - Sound & Comm Installer: Base $35-$48/hr + Fringe $18-$28/hr = Loaded $53-$76/hr
   - Telecom Technician: Base $30-$42/hr + Fringe $15-$25/hr = Loaded $45-$67/hr
   - Laborer: Base $22-$32/hr + Fringe $15-$22/hr = Loaded $37-$54/hr
   - Operating Engineer: Base $40-$55/hr + Fringe $25-$35/hr = Loaded $65-$90/hr

   FRINGE BENEFIT COMPONENTS (typical):
   - Health & Welfare insurance
   - Pension / retirement fund
   - Vacation / holiday pay
   - Training / apprenticeship fund
   - FICA, FUTA, SUTA (employer payroll taxes)
   - Workers' compensation insurance
   - General liability insurance allocation

   APPRENTICE GUIDELINES:
   - Apprentice-to-journeyman ratios vary by trade and jurisdiction (typically 1:1 to 1:3)
   - Apprentice rates are a percentage of journeyman rate based on period (1st period: 50%, 2nd: 55%, etc.)
   - Must be registered in approved apprenticeship program
   - Flag any tasks where apprentice labor can reduce costs

   CERTIFIED PAYROLL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Weekly certified payroll (WH-347) required for Davis-Bacon projects
   - All workers must be classified correctly — misclassification is a federal violation
   - Overtime: 1.5x base rate after 40 hours/week (fringe stays the same)
   - Penalty for underpayment: back wages + liquidated damages + potential debarment

   LABOR COST SUMMARY — Apply loaded rates to all labor hours:
   | Classification | Hours | Loaded Rate | Total Cost |
   |----------------|-------|-------------|------------|
   | Electrician | X hrs | $XX.XX/hr | $X,XXX |
   | Sound & Comm | X hrs | $XX.XX/hr | $X,XXX |
   | Laborer | X hrs | $XX.XX/hr | $X,XXX |
   | Operating Eng | X hrs | $XX.XX/hr | $X,XXX |
   | Foreman | X hrs | $XX.XX/hr | $X,XXX |
   | **TOTAL LABOR COST** | **X hrs** | | **$XX,XXX** |

   If prevailing wage is NOT selected, skip this section and note: "Standard (non-prevailing) labor rates apply. No certified payroll required."

   SOV GUIDELINES FOR THE PM:
   - **Retainage**: Typically 10% held until substantial completion, reduced to 5% at 50% complete (verify contract terms)
   - **Front-loading**: Distribute values so early phases (mobilization, rough-in) carry slightly higher material values for cash flow
   - **Granularity**: Break large-value items into sub-items when a single line exceeds 15% of total contract value
   - **Change Orders**: Reserve a contingency line or note that COs will be added as separate SOV line items
   - **Stored Materials**: If contract allows billing for stored materials, note which line items may have early material procurement
   - **Percentage Complete**: Each line item should be billable by percentage complete per month
   - **Balancing**: Total of all SOV line items MUST equal the total contract value

   For each SOV line item, calculate the Scheduled Value using:
   - Material cost (from the Overall Material Summary)
   - Labor cost (from the Labor Summary, with shift/prevailing wage adjustments)
   - Equipment rental allocation
   - Subcontractor cost allocation
   - Proportional share of General Conditions

   Produce the SOV as a complete table ready for direct entry into an AIA G703 form.

13. **PRICED ESTIMATE SUMMARY** — Using the PRICING CONFIGURATION data provided above, calculate the complete project cost. This is MANDATORY — produce ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS, not placeholders.

   MATERIAL COST BREAKDOWN:
   | Category | Item Count | Material Cost | Markup (${state.markup.material}%) | Sell Price |
   |----------|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|
   | (one row per major material category) |

   LABOR COST BREAKDOWN:
   | Classification | Hours | Loaded Rate | Labor Cost | Markup (${state.markup.labor}%) | Sell Price |
   |----------------|-------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
   | (one row per labor classification) |

   PROJECT COST SUMMARY:
   | Cost Category | Cost | Markup | Sell Price |
   |---------------|------|--------|------------|
   | Total Materials | $X,XXX | ${state.markup.material}% | $X,XXX |
   | Total Labor | $X,XXX | ${state.markup.labor}% | $X,XXX |
   | Equipment Rentals | $X,XXX | ${state.markup.equipment}% | $X,XXX |
   | Subcontractors | $X,XXX | ${state.markup.subcontractor}% | $X,XXX |
   | Travel & Per Diem | $X,XXX | — | $X,XXX |
   | **TOTAL PROJECT PRICE** | **$XX,XXX** | | **$XX,XXX** |

   Include notes on:
   - What's included vs excluded
   - Assumptions made
   - Contingency recommendation (typically 5-10%)
   - Payment terms suggestion

14. **CODE COMPLIANCE SUMMARY** — Dedicated summary section:
   - Total issues found: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning / 🔵 Info
   - Each issue with code reference, location, and recommended action
   - Items requiring AHJ approval or inspection
   - Permits likely required (fire alarm, low voltage, electrical)

15. Analysis observations:
   - Device counts by type, per sheet/floor
   - Cable/conduit pathway observations
   - Spec-to-plan conflicts
   - Missing info requiring RFIs
   - Scope gaps or ambiguities
   - Confidence level for each count

16. Specific, actionable RFI questions with code references where applicable.
17. If known quantities provided, compare and flag deviations over 10%.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use markdown headers (##) to organize each major section
- Follow this exact section order:
  1. ## CODE & STANDARDS COMPLIANCE REVIEW
  2. ## MDF/IDF MATERIAL BREAKDOWN (per room)
  3. ## OVERALL MATERIAL SUMMARY (with unit prices and extended costs)
  4. ## LABOR SUMMARY (hours by discipline, by phase, with loaded rates and dollar totals)
  5. ## PREVAILING WAGE DETERMINATION (if applicable — classifications, rates, labor cost)
  6. ## SPECIAL EQUIPMENT & CONDITIONS (⚠️ flags and cost impact)
  7. ## TRAVEL & PER DIEM ESTIMATE (cost table by phase)
  8. ## SCHEDULE OF VALUES (SOV) — AIA G703 format with dollar amounts
  9. ## PRICED ESTIMATE SUMMARY (material + labor + equipment + sub + markup = total price)
  10. ## CODE COMPLIANCE SUMMARY (issue count table)
  11. ## OBSERVATIONS & ANALYSIS
  12. ## RFIs
- Use tables where possible for readability
- ALL cost tables must show ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS calculated from the pricing data provided
- Tag code issues: 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 WARNING, 🔵 INFO
- Tag special equipment: ⚠️ with cost impact ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)
- Include confidence percentage for each major count
- Reference sheet numbers, room numbers, device types
- Detailed enough for PM procurement, labor planning, wage compliance, progress billing, travel budgeting, equipment scheduling, and subcontractor coordination`;

YOUR TASK: Audit the following AI-generated estimate for accuracy, completeness, and internal consistency. You are NOT regenerating the estimate — you are VERIFYING it.

CHECK THE FOLLOWING:
1. **MATH VERIFICATION**: For every table with Qty × Unit Cost = Extended Cost, verify the multiplication is correct. Flag ANY math errors.
2. **CROSS-REFERENCE TOTALS**: Verify that section subtotals add up to the grand total in the SOV / Estimate Summary.
3. **QUANTITY CONSISTENCY**: Check that device counts mentioned in the observations match the quantities in the material tables. Flag if a count says "48 cameras" but the material table shows 42.
4. **COST REASONABLENESS**: Flag any unit costs that seem unreasonable (e.g., a Cat6A cable drop priced at $5,000 or a camera at $15). Use your knowledge of typical ELV pricing.
5. **MISSING ITEMS**: Check if any standard items are missing for the systems described (e.g., access control system with readers but no controller, CCTV cameras but no NVR, structured cabling without patch panels).
6. **CODE COMPLIANCE**: Verify that the code citations are accurate — correct NFPA/NEC article numbers and requirements.
7. **LABOR HOURS**: Check if the labor hours seem reasonable for the scope described. Flag if a 200-camera project shows only 40 labor hours.
8. **MARKUP CALCULATIONS**: Verify that markup percentages were applied correctly to base costs.
